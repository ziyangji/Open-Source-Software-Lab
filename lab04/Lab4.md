*  We need to choose a license because it allows software to be freely used, modified, and shared. 
*  Code with no license to the copyright isn't open source.
*  A software license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software.
      
### 4.
*  There is legal risk if there is no explicit license
*  We cannot modify or redistribute this code without explicit permission from the copyright holder.
*  We have no rights to do anything at all with this code.

*  I agree with his claim. The developers would prefer a plateform which is easier for them to use and which is free.
   The user prefer using something with a better UI and compaticable with more protocols.

### 6.
*  Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license. If the license is
   just a GPL license, the developers have to open source there products. Not all developers want to open source their 
   products. So in order to attract more developers, Android use Apache license, the developers don't have to open source
   the change they made, which can attract more developers.  (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%E8%AE%B8%E5%8F%AF%E8%AF%81#%E4%B8%8EGPL%E7%9A%84%E5%85%BC%E5%AE%B9)
